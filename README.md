# Predicting Crystal Structures from Material Data (Minerals Dataset)

### Importing the necessary libraries

- Data manipulation and analysis
- Plotting library for visualizations
- Statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib
- Dimensionality reduction technique
- Preprocessing tools for standardization
- Data splitting for model evaluation
- K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for classification tasks
- Metrics for model evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)

---

### Loading the Data Set

- Reading the Data Set

---

### Data Preprocessing

- Drop the column named "Unnamed: 0" from the DataFrame 'df'
- Checking for the Null Values
- Applying KNN Model with the Target as Crystal Structure

---

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Separate features (X) and target (y)
- Perform Label Encoding on the target variable
- Data Preprocessing: Scale/Normalize features
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Instantiate KNN classifier
- Train the model
- Make predictions
- Evaluate the model
- Plotting a Confusion Matrix

---

### Decision Tree Classifier

- Separate features (X) and target (y)
- Data Preprocessing: Scale/Normalize features
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Create Decision Tree classifier object
- Train Decision Tree Classifier
- Predict the response for the test dataset
- Calculate and print the accuracy of the model
- Plotting Confusion Matrix

---

### Random Forest

- Separate features (X) and target (y)
- Perform Label Encoding on the target variable
- Data Preprocessing: Scale/Normalize features
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Instantiate Random Forest classifier
- Train the model
- Make predictions
- Evaluate the model
- Plotting Confusion Matrix

### Conclusion:

- **Model Comparison:** Among the three models tested, the Random Forest Classifier performed the best, demonstrating the highest accuracy and better predictive capabilities across different 'Crystal Structure' categories.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Despite the success of the Random Forest model, there's still room for improvement, especially in handling specific 'Crystal Structure' classes where precision and recall were relatively low across all models.
- **Next Steps:** Further feature engineering, exploring different algorithms, or adjusting model hyperparameters could potentially enhance predictive performance, leading to more accurate classification of 'Crystal Structure' based on mineral characteristics.
